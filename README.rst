Programs producing pictures related to base64 encoding.
Please bear in mind that the programs are ad-hoc scripts, nothing fancy.

* ``base64-avx2`` [python -> tikz -> LaTeX] --- `Faster Base64 Encoding and Decoding Using AVX2 Instructions`__
* ``base64-avx512`` [python -> tikz -> LaTeX] --- `Base64 encoding and decoding at almost the speed of a memory copy`__
* ``base64-pic-website`` [PIC__ -> inkspace -> png]  --- `AVX512F base64 coding and decoding`__
